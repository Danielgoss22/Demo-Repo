# Horiseon-Website

## Description

- Horiseon's website had one broken link and a plethera of unnessesary code that needed to be cleaned up.
- I looked through and organized HTML into a more sematic structure, and consoliated the CSS file to eliminate duplicate code.
- This first fixed the broken link within the HTMl and second made it easier to read the code.
- I learned that when setting up an <a> you cannot forget to add a # otherwise the link will break.
- I also learned that just becuase setting a class for every section or element works; it is not the most efficient way to write your code.
